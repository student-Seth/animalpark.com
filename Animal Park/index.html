        <h2>Our Animals</h2>
        <p>We have a diverse range of animals including lions, tigers, bears, and many more. Each species has a dedicated habitat that mimics their natural environment.</p>
        <h3> asiatic lion</h3>
        <p> The Asiatic lion (Panthera leo persica) is a lion subspecies native to the Gir Forest of Gujarat, India. Distinguished by their slightly smaller size and less pronounced mane compared to their African counterparts, Asiatic lions exhibit a unique tuft of hair on their elbows and a longitudinal fold of skin running along their bellies. Once widespread across the Middle East and into parts of Europe, their population has drastically declined due to habitat loss, hunting, and human-wildlife conflict. Today, conservation efforts have helped stabilize their numbers, making the Gir Forest a critical sanctuary for this endangered species. These lions play a vital role in the ecosystem, maintaining the balance by preying on herbivores and influencing the vegetation dynamics of their habitat.</p>

        <h3>Indian elephant</h3>
        <p>The Indian elephant (Elephas maximus indicus) is a majestic and culturally significant subspecies of the Asian elephant found predominantly in the Indian subcontinent. Characterized by their large ears, curved tusks, and distinctive trunk, these elephants are revered in Indian mythology and religion, often symbolizing wisdom and strength. Indian elephants inhabit a range of environments, including grasslands, forests, and scrublands, and play a crucial role in their ecosystems by facilitating seed dispersal and creating clearings in dense forest areas</p>

        <h3>bengal tigers</h3>
        <p>The Bengal tiger of India, scientifically known as (Panthera tigris tigris), is a symbol of strength and grace, and it holds a special place in Indian culture and mythology. This magnificent predator is most commonly found in the diverse landscapes of India, ranging from the lush forests of the Sundarbans and the grasslands of Ranthambore to the dense jungles of Corbett and Bandhavgarh. Known for its distinctive orange coat with black stripes, the Bengal tiger is the largest tiger subspecies, with males often weighing between 400 to 570 pounds and measuring up to 10 feet in length. As an apex predator, it plays a crucial role in maintaining the health of the ecosystems by controlling the population of herbivores such as deer and wild boar. However, the Bengal tiger is endangered due to habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict, with an estimated 2,500 individuals remaining in the wild. Conservation initiatives, including protected reserves and anti-poaching measures, are vital to ensuring the survival of this iconic species, which is a source of national pride for India.</p>

        <h3>snow leopards</h3>
        <p>Snow leopards (Panthera uncia) are elusive and enigmatic big cats native to the rugged mountainous regions of Central and South Asia. Known for their beautiful smoky-gray fur with black rosettes and spots, these magnificent creatures are perfectly adapted to the harsh, cold environments they inhabit, including the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau. Snow leopards have powerful hind legs that enable them to leap up to 50 feet, an essential skill for traversing steep and rocky terrains. They are solitary animals, with a diet primarily consisting of blue sheep, ibex, and other mountain ungulates. Classified as vulnerable, snow leopards face significant threats from habitat loss, poaching, and retaliatory killings by herders. With an estimated population of only 4,000 to 6,500 individuals in the wild, concerted conservation efforts are vital to protect these elusive predators and preserve the fragile ecosystems they call home.</p>
